> Please note that the **rosbags `eight2` and `eight22` are mislabeled**:
> the rosbag named `eight2` actually recorded the `eight22` trajectory, while the rosbag named `eight22` contains the `eight2` trajectory.
> This mismatch should be taken into account when conducting further experiments and when analyzing results in this repository.
